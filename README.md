# heart-failure-random-forest

A comparison of a tuned decision tree model vs. an untuned random forest model on predicting heart failure from patent data.

## Methodology

1. Analyze data and gain an understanding of the dataset.
2. Select relevant features and format them appropriately.
3. Train a decision tree predictive model on the selected features.
4. Tune the decision tree model.
5. Train a random forest predictive model on the selected features.
6. Compare the accuracy of each model.

## Modelling

The comparison was conducted using the sklearn package and the following two models:

1. Decision Tree Regressor
2. Random Forest Regressor
